Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after skirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties. 
   ``We've already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip.
   Most Jamaicans stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane. 
   Officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the south coast to seek higher ground.
   ``We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be a major threat to the United States,'' said Martin Nelson, another meteorologist at the center. 
   The storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas of southwestern Puerto Rico after reaching hurricane strength off the island's southeast Saturday night.
