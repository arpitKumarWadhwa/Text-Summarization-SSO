Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
   Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, stealing from stores whose windows were blown away. Huge waves battered the beach resorts and thousands were evacuated. 
   The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000 of the nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
   The storm was about 550 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the center said in a statement.
   As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again.
   ``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
