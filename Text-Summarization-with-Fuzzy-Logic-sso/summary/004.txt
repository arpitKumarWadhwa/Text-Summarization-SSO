Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
   Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, stealing from stores whose windows were blown away. Huge waves battered the beach resorts and thousands were evacuated. 
   Despite the intensity of the onslaught and the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minor injuries.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.
   By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There's no question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan Peninsula and gets back in open water.''
   As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again.
