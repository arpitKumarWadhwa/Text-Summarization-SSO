Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
   No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of 750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon.
   For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air.
   Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path of the hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting short their vacations. ``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their heads cut off,'' said one man.
   A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. 
   High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingston overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches.
   Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the island.
