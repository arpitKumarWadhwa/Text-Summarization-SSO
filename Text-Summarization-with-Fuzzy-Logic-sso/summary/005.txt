Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.
   ``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. 
   Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.
   ``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck said.
   ``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for development,'' Clark said. ``If you get a storm in this area in September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This is where Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the Gulf Coast.
