Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.
   ``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. 
   ``It doesn't happen very often. How it develops, we don't know.''
   ``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer. About one of six develop,'' said Clark.
   It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.
   That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
