Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
   For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air.
   It said Jamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would cause flash floods and mud slides.
   Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane.
   In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane.
