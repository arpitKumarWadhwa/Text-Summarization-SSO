Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.
   Floods prevented officials from reaching the hotel zone in Cancun and there were no relief efforts under way by late Wednesday. Shelters had little or no food, water or blankets and power was out.
   By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There's no question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan Peninsula and gets back in open water.''
   One eye was about eight miles wide, and the second about 25 miles wide, said hurricane center meteorologist Jesse Moore.
